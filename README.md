This game was made as a university project from 2nd year of studying (subject OOP).
Variables, classes and methods are named in Serbian.
For writing this code I used a combination of my knowledge, Youtube tutorials and StackOverflow.
Game is not done, I plan to work on this code more, but this was required for my grade.
Player can move with ASWD, point of game is to collect as much coins as you can.
I worked on this game before I had a GitHub account, that's why code is published at once.
