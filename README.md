This game was made as a university project from 2nd year of studying (subject OOP).<br>
Variables, classes and methods are named in Serbian.<br>
For writing this code I used a combination of my knowledge, Youtube tutorials and StackOverflow.<br>
Game is not done, I plan to work on this code more, but this was required for my grade.<br>
Player can move with ASWD, point of game is to collect as much coins as you can.<br>
I worked on this game before I had a GitHub account, that's why code is published at once.
